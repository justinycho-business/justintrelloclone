## About
Justin_Trello_Clone is a clone of [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US), a project management website that was acquired by Atlassian in 2017. I chose to work on this project because it is such a simple yet powerful tool. With a project management background, I recognize the usefulness of breaking down large tasks into smaller little tasks. It does so much for our human brains. I wanted to implement Drag and Drop functionality and put a spin on Trello with exciting colors to make project management a fun activity. 

I partitioned my project into 5 phases during a 2-week sprint. These phases were planning my database and backend routes, implementing user authentication, putting together board UI, implementing Drag and Drop, and implementing a progress bar for each checklist.  I used Python, Javascript, React, and Redux to put my web-based project management tool together. 

## Technologies
* Frontend: Javascript, React, Redux
* Backend: Python
* Relational Database: PostgreSQL 
* Drag and Drop: [React Beautiful DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)
* Styling: CSS and HTML5

### Future Features
* Dark mode 
* Bar graph for # cards in each list
* Permit multiple users on a board
